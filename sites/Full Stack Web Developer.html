                <h2 style="border-bottom: 0px;">What is a Full Stack developer?</h2><br>
                <p>
                    Is it reasonable to expect mere mortals to have mastery over every facet of the development stack? Probably not, but Facebook can ask for it. I was told at OSCON by a Facebook employee that they only hire ‘Full Stack’ developers. Well,
                </p><br>
                <h2 style="border-bottom: 0px;">what does that mean?</h2><br>
                <p>
                    To me, a Full Stack Developer is someone with familiarity in each layer, if not mastery in many and a genuine interest in all software technology.<br> Good developers who are familiar with the entire stack know how to make life easier
                    for those around them. This is why I’m so against silos in the work place. Sure, politics and communication challenges get in the way in large organizations. I think the point Facebook is going for with their hiring policy is, if smart
                    people use their heads and their hearts, a better product gets built in less time.<br> Layers of the Full Stack:<br> Server, Network, and Hosting Environment.<br> This involves understanding what can break and why, taking no resource
                    for granted.<br> Appropriate use of the file system, cloud storage, network resources, and an understanding of data redundancy and availability is necessary.<br>
                </p><br>
                <h2 style="border-bottom: 0px;">How does the application scale given the hardware constraints?</h2><br>
                <h2 style="border-bottom: 0px;">What about multi-threading</h2><br>
                <h2 style="border-bottom: 0px;"> and race conditions? </h2><br>
                <p>
                    Guess what, you won’t see those on your development machine, but they can and do happen in the real world.<br> Full stack developers can work side by side with DevOps. The system should provide useful error messages and logging capabilities.<br>                    DevOps will see the messages before you will, so make them count.<br> Data Modeling<br>
                    <center><img src="../Full Stack Web Developer/full.jpg" /></center><br> If the data model is flawed, the business logic and higher layers start to need strange (ugly) code to compensate for corner cases the data model doesn’t cover.<br> Full
                    stack developers know how to create a reasonably normalized relational model, complete with foreign keys, indexes, views, lookup tables, etc.<br> Full stack developers are familiar with the concept of non-relational data stores and
                    understand where they shine over relational data stores.<br> Business Logic <br> The heart of the value the application provides.<br> Solid object oriented skills are needed here.<br> Frameworks might be needed here as well.<br> API
                    layer / Action Layer / MVC
                    <br> How the outside world operates against the business logic and data model.<br> Frameworks at this level should be used heavily.<br> Full stack developers have the ability to write clear, consistent, simple to use interfaces. The
                    heights to which some APIs are convoluted repel me.<br> User Interface<br> Full stack developers: a) understand how to create a readable layout, or b) acknowledge they need help from artists and graphic designers. Either way, implementing
                    a good visual design is key.<br> Can include mastery of HTML5 / CSS.<br> JavaScript is the up and coming language of the future and lots of exciting work is being done in the JavaScript world (node, backbone, knockout…)<br> User Experience<br>                    Full stack developers appreciate
                </p><br><br>
                <h2 style="border-bottom: 0px;">What is a Full-Stack Developer?</h2><br>
                <p><br> We have talked before about different types of programmers, but we have yet to touch on the elusive “ full-stack developer. ” Varying definitions of this title exist: from a developer specialized in everything from front-end to back-end;
                    to a developer who has a general knowledge in all steps from concept to finished product; to a fictional figure with a virtually unattainable skill set.<br> Full-stack die-hards would consider a full-stack developer to have specialized
                    knowledge in all stages of software development. Thus, a full-stack developer would be proficient, if not fluent, in:<br> • Server, network, and hosting environment<br> • Relational and nonrelational databases<br> • How to interact
                    with APIs and the external world<br> • User interface and user experience<br> • Quality assurance<br> • Security concerns throughout the program<br> • Understanding customer and business needs<br>
                    <center><img src="../Full Stack Web Developer/full stack.jpg" /> </center> <br> Is this possible in Web 2.0? Naysayers argue that with the increasingly diverse aspects of web development, it’s virtually impossible to be a true full-stack developer.<br>                    Frankly, it may not even be practical to do so.<br> Others are of the opinion that a full-stack developer is simply someone who is familiar with all layers in computer software development. These developers aren’t experts at everything;
                    they simply have a functional knowledge and ability to take a concept and turn it into a finished product. Such gurus make building software much easier as they understand how everything works from top to bottom and can anticipate
                    problems accordingly.<br> In our opinion, this is the most realistic definition of a full-stack developer.<br> Often times, this class of developers stems from start-up environments, where a vast knowledge of all facets of web development
                    is essential for a business’ survival.
                    <br> Clearly, it takes years of work experience in different languages, roles, and industries to reach this level of qualification. Because of this, full stack developers are few <br>

                <h2 style="border-bottom: 0px;">What does the term "full-stack programmer" mean?</h2><br>
                <p>
                    What are the defining traits of a full-stack programmer?<br> • Working with systems infrastructure (knowing what hardware to ask for , what OS to install, how to prepare the system and dependencies for all software)<br> • Understanding,
                    creating, manipulating, and querying databases<br> • API / back-end code in one or more languages, e.g. Ruby, Java, Python, etc.<br> • Front-end code in one or more languages, e.g. HTML, JavaScript, Java, etc.<br> • Project management
                    / client work,e.g.
                    <br> gathering requirements, creating technical specifications and architecture documents, creating good documentation, managing a project timeline (e.g., someone who knows Agile/SCRUM/Kanban)<br> In general a full-stack developer
                    has knowledge that is a mile wide, but not necessarily very deep, and has core competencies in the pieces of the stack in which they work most.<br> In my work I have core competencies in Linux (Debian, CentOS, Amazon Linux), Database
                    design, manipulation,and query (PSQL and MySQL), back-end technologies (Java, Ruby, and Python), and some front-end design (HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and jQuery), as well as act as SCRUM-master and lead Agile development for my team,
                    interfacing with clients both internal and external to the business to gather requirements, execute tasks, and document all efforts.<br> Typically these skills are developed over many years in the contexts of different jobs, so as
                    Ian mentioned being a full-stack developer means being pushed outside <br><br> Source: George Clooney Nod GIF - Find & Share on GIPHY<br> Like software development, your body has things that interact directly with the outside world
                    (like skin) and things that don’t (your internal organs). Dermatologists and Plastic Surgeons deals with the outside. These are like your front-end developers. Cardiologists and Gastroenterologists deals with your insides. These are
                    like your back-end developers. A primary care doctor can help you with both a skin problem and a stomach infection. These are your full stack developers.<br> In other words, a full stack engineer can do a bit of everything. Does that
                    mean they are the best at both? Not necessarily.<br> Here are a few traits that are common to all full stack developers:<br> They can work on both the front-end and the back-end<br> This can mean that they have a broad understanding
                    of a variety of languages and architectures but it can equally mean that they can simply use the same language for the front-end and back-end (ex. Python with the Django framework)<br> They can see whether a problem would be best solved
                    on the front-end or the back-end<br> Since they have experience with both ends of the development process, they have a better idea of the solutions on both ends. This means that they have a better insight into what is possible at both
                    ends of development and whether a problem would be best solved by the front-end team or the back-end team. Their global perspective can also make them good managers and team leaders.<br>
